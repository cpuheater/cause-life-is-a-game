### Solving video games with Deep Reinforcement Learning!
Each directory contains files related to a specific game. Each file is a self-contained rl algorithm.    
The core algorithms are based on [cleanrl](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) and comes with many 
cleanrl goodies like: tensorboard logging, videos of gameplay capturing, experiment 
management with [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site).
